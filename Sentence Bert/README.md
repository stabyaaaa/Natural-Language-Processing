## Web Application
To access the web application for the Sentence Embedding, you can run the `main.py` file. Once the Flask server is up and running, you can access the application by navigating to `localhost:5000` in your web browser.

Make sure to update the necessary configurations, such as host and port settings, in the main.py file if you want to run the application on a different address or port.

You can start the Flask server by executing the following command in your terminal:
`python main.py`
